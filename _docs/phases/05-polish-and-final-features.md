# Phase 5: Polish, Final Features & Launch Readiness

- **Phase:** 5 of 5
- **Status:** Not Started
- **Goal:** To complete the feature set, polish the user experience, and prepare the application for a public launch. This phase is about moving from a feature-complete product to a refined and delightful one.

## Scope and Deliverables

### Scope
- The final core AI feature: the "Critical Thinking Prompter."
- A document export feature.
- A comprehensive UI/UX polish pass, including animations, transitions, and final design system alignment.
- Performance optimization and final testing.

### Deliverables
- Users are presented with thought-provoking questions about their claims as they write.
- Users can export their finished documents to common formats like `.txt` and `.docx`.
- The entire application feels smooth, responsive, and professionally designed, with a consistent and polished look and feel.
- The application is performant, with optimized load times and efficient AI interactions.

## Actionable Steps

### 1. Implement Critical Thinking Prompter (Real-Time)
1.  Add logic to the editor to periodically send the user's latest paragraph to a new Edge Function.
2.  Create the Edge Function (`/supabase/functions/critical-thinking-prompter`).
3.  Engineer a prompt that instructs the AI to identify the main claim in the paragraph and generate a thought-provoking question to encourage deeper analysis.
4.  Design and implement a non-intrusive UI element (e.g., a small icon in the margin) to indicate that a "thinking prompt" is available.
5.  When the user clicks the icon, reveal the question in a popover or sidebar.

### 2. Add Document Export Functionality
1.  Research and select a client-side library for converting HTML or text content to different formats (e.g., `html-to-docx`, `jspdf`).
2.  Add an "Export" button to the editor interface.
3.  Implement the logic to take the final document content and convert it into `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` formats, triggering a download in the browser.

### 3. UI/UX Polish Pass
1.  Review the entire application against `ui-rules.md` and `theme-rules.md` to ensure consistency.
2.  Add subtle and meaningful transitions and animations to improve the user experience (e.g., fade-in for modals, smooth sidebar transitions).
3.  Refine all UI components, ensuring perfect alignment, spacing, and responsiveness across all target devices.
4.  Review all microcopy (button text, tooltips, empty states) to ensure it is clear, concise, and helpful.

### 4. Performance & Final Testing
1.  Analyze frontend bundle sizes and identify opportunities for optimization.
2.  Review all database queries and ensure they are efficient and use indexes where appropriate.
3.  Review all Edge Functions for performance, optimizing prompts and response parsing.
4.  Conduct end-to-end testing of all user flows to identify and fix any remaining bugs.
