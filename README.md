## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Step 1: Production Supabase Setup

1. **Create Production Project:**
   ```bash
   # Create a new project at https://supabase.com/dashboard
   # Note your project URL and anon key
   ```

2. **Deploy Database Schema:**
   ```bash
   # Link to your production project
   supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
   
   # Push database schema to production
   supabase db push
   ```

3. **Deploy Edge Functions:**
   ```bash
   # Deploy all AI functions to production
   supabase functions deploy grammar-check
   supabase functions deploy academic-voice  
   supabase functions deploy thesis-analyzer
   supabase functions deploy evidence-mentor
   supabase functions deploy argument-coach
   supabase functions deploy critical-thinking-prompter
   ```

4. **Configure Secrets:**
   ```bash
   # Set OpenAI API key for edge functions
   supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 2: Vercel Deployment

1. **Connect Repository:**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Add these in Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy on push to main branch
   - First deployment may take 2-3 minutes
