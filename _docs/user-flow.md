# User Flow: EssayElevate

This document outlines the user journey for a high school student using EssayElevate to improve their academic writing. It covers the path from initial sign-up to using advanced AI features.

## 1. Onboarding and Authentication

1.  **Landing Page:** A new user visits the EssayElevate homepage, which highlights the key features and benefits for high school students.
2.  **Sign-Up:** The user clicks "Sign Up" and creates an account using their email and password or a social login (e.g., Google).
3.  **Login:** Returning users log in to access their dashboard.

## 2. Document Management (Dashboard)

1.  **Dashboard View:** Upon logging in, the user lands on their dashboard.
2.  **Document List:** The dashboard displays a list of their saved documents, showing titles and last modified dates.
3.  **Actions:** From the dashboard, the user can:
    *   Create a new, blank document.
    *   Open an existing document to continue writing.
    *   Rename or delete existing documents.

## 3. The Editor - Core Writing Experience

1.  **Interface:** Opening a document loads a clean, distraction-free editor. The main area is for text input, with a sidebar or toolbar for AI features and suggestions.
2.  **Real-time Grammar and Style Checking:**
    *   As the user types, the system automatically checks for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors in real-time.
    *   Errors are underlined in different colors based on their type (e.g., red for spelling, blue for grammar).
    *   Clicking on an underlined word/phrase reveals a card with suggestions for correction and a brief explanation of the rule, helping the user learn. The user can accept, ignore, or see more details about the suggestion.

## 4. AI-Powered Writing Enhancement

This is the core of the user journey, where students interact with specialized AI assistants. We assume a hybrid model for feature activation: some features are real-time, while others are user-triggered for more in-depth analysis.

### Feature Interaction Model:

*   **Real-Time (Passive):** Features that run constantly in the background as the user types (e.g., grammar, academic voice).
*   **On-Demand (Active):** Features that require user intent to run, typically for analyzing a larger piece of text like a thesis or the full essay. This prevents overwhelming the user with too much information at once.

### 4.1 Academic Voice Elevator (Real-Time)

1.  **Detection:** The AI continuously scans the text for casual or informal language (e.g., "a lot of," "thing," "you").
2.  **Suggestion:** Casual phrases are subtly highlighted.
3.  **Interaction:** Clicking the highlight shows a suggestion to elevate the language to a more academic tone (e.g., "a lot of" -> "a significant amount of"). The user can accept the change with one click.

### 4.2 Thesis Evolution Engine (On-Demand)

1.  **Identification:**
    *   **Assumption:** The AI is trained to automatically detect thesis statements, typically found at the end of the introductory paragraph. It highlights what it believes is the thesis and asks for confirmation ("Is this your thesis statement?").
    *   Alternatively, the user can manually highlight their thesis statement and select an "Improve Thesis" option from a context menu or toolbar.
2.  **Analysis & Suggestions:**
    *   Upon confirmation, the AI analyzes the thesis for clarity, argument strength, and specificity.
    *   It provides feedback in a side panel, offering several revised versions or specific suggestions, such as "Consider adding the main points of your argument to the thesis."

### 4.3 Evidence Integration Mentor (Real-Time / On-Demand)

1.  **Quote Detection:** The AI automatically identifies quoted material (text within quotation marks).
2.  **Contextual Analysis (Real-Time):**
    *   After a user inserts a quote, the AI analyzes the surrounding sentences.
    *   If the quote is not properly introduced or followed by analysis (i.e., "quote-dropping"), a prompt appears.
3.  **Guidance:** The prompt offers guidance, such as:
    *   "Add a sentence before this quote to introduce the author or context."
    *   "Explain how this evidence supports your argument in the following sentence."

### 4.4 Argument Sophistication Coach (On-Demand)

1.  **Activation:** The user finishes a draft or a significant section and clicks an "Analyze Argument" button in the toolbar.
2.  **Holistic Review:** The AI performs a full-text analysis to check for:
    *   Logical flow and consistency.
    *   Unsupported claims.
    *   Weak reasoning or logical fallacies.
3.  **Feedback Delivery:** The feedback is delivered as comments in the margin, linked to specific sentences or paragraphs. This avoids cluttering the main text. Clicking a comment highlights the relevant text.

### 4.5 Critical Thinking Prompter (Real-Time)

1.  **Claim Detection:** As the user writes, the AI identifies key claims and arguments.
2.  **Prompt Generation:** The AI generates thought-provoking questions related to the claim, which appear in a non-intrusive way (e.g., a small lightbulb icon in the margin).
3.  **Interaction:** Clicking the icon reveals a question designed to deepen analysis, such as:
    *   "What might be a counter-argument to this point?"
    *   "What are the underlying assumptions behind this claim?"
    *   "Can you provide a more specific example to illustrate this idea?"

## 5. Document Finalization and Export

1.  **Review:** The user reviews all suggestions and finalizes their essay.
2.  **Export:** The user can export the final document, likely in formats like `.docx`, `.pdf`, or plain text.
